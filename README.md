# 🔐 SecureLink: One-Time Encrypted Link Generator

A serverless Python-based application that allows users to generate encrypted, one-time-use links to securely share confidential messages. Powered by AWS Lambda and API Gateway, SecureLink ensures privacy, encryption, and auto-destruction of sensitive content after first access.

---

## 🚀 Features

- One-time access: Each link can only be used once.
- AES-256 encryption using cryptography.fernet.
- Unique URLs via UUID tokens.
- Fully serverless and scalable using AWS Lambda.
- Easy integration with frontend or API clients.

## 🛠 AWS Services Used

| AWS Service        | Purpose                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| AWS Lambda         | Executes encryption, link generation, and self-destruction logic |
| Amazon API Gateway | Exposes HTTP endpoints to interact with Lambda |
| AWS CloudWatch     | Logs all requests and errors for monitoring   |
| AWS IAM            | Provides access control and execution permissions |

## 🧠 How AWS Lambda is Used

AWS Lambda is the backend compute engine for this app. It:
- Accepts a POST request to /generate with a secret message.
- Encrypts the message using AES (Fernet) and generates a unique UUID.
- Stores the encrypted message temporarily in a dictionary (or DB).
- Generates a one-time-use URL tied to the UUID.
- When accessed via GET /access/{uuid}, it decrypts the message once, deletes it, and blocks further access.

This architecture allows complete stateless, serverless, scalable deployment without managing any infrastructure.

### `POST /generate`  
**Description**: Generate a one-time secure link.

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "message": "Your secret message"

```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "link": "https://your-api-url/access/<uuid>",
  "message": "🔗 One-time link generated!"
}
```

### Response (First access):
```json
{
  "decrypted_message": "Your secret message",
  "status": "✅ Message Retrieved"
}
```

### Response (After use):
```json
